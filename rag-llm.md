For retrieval: Let’s stick with a sentence-transformer model called all-MiniLM-L6-v2. It’s lightweight, works well for general similarity tasks, and is easy to use with Hugging Face.

For generation: Start with gpt2 (the basic version). It’s not huge, but it does a good job for general text generation. We can upgrade later if needed.
